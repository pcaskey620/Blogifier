                        Parker and I grew up in Murfreesboro, TN and have known each other since at least 2nd grade.
                        As we got older we did our own thing, attending different colleges and doing quite a bit of our own traveling.
                        Parker moved out to Denver, Colorado after graduating college in 2014 to enjoy all things the mountain life offered.
                        I lived in Nashville for a few years until I started travel nursing where I lived all over the United States before taking an assignment in Denver.
                        We reunited over a mutual passion for winter sports, though Parker, being a snowboarder, jokes that he never thought his favorite person to go to the mountains with would be a skier.
                        We got to know each other again after numerous car rides sitting in traffic on I-70 coming to and from the mountains.
                        It took us awhile to finally make the jump across the friend zone and it was actually before Parker and I were even dating that he said to me,

                        I laugh and say, “Let’s do it,” thinking this is all a purely hypothetical plan. Here we are a little over a year later ready for our next adventure.
